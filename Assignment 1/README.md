## Background:
### The Issues:
The tenant selection process is crucial to landlords in order to minimize or to avoid rental losses, damages to the property, or other potential conflicts between tenant and landlord. One example is conducing a credit check, however, doctoring a credit check is easy which has been described as a huge problem within the industry. Although, landlords can pay to obtain credit checks from the credit bureaus, such as Equifax or TransUnion, they might still not able to understand the report properly or they might have no idea about how credit relates to a tenant’s capacity to pay rent on time. For example, maybe they do not know what an R9 is or how someone paying telephone bill on time impacts their ability to pay rent. Moreover, according to Bank of Montreal’s report, around 70 percent of surveyed Canadian are willing to delay buying a home, and they plan to continue renting. Consequently, landlords in some areas might be overwhelmed by applicants, thus, they are less likely to have time to decipher a tenant’s capacity for prompt rent payments. Furthermore, the cost of eviction is expensive (*around $9000 in Ontario*), which reduces the profitability of a rental property investment. And fail to receive rent for several months might create serious issue for the landlords to pay their mortgages and they could lose the property.

### Fintech and Landlord Services:
Many financial services startups aim to provide a more intensive overview of prospective tenants for landlords. They use ‘big data’ and machine learning to automatically evaluate tenants’ profile including identity, income, and employment status, to analyze tenants’ creditworthiness, and to predict the likelihood of late rent payments, and even potential interpersonal conflicts between roommates.

## Naborly’s Business:
### Leveraging the Power of Technology and Data:
Naborly’s analysis is powered by Equifax, which offers landlords a quick snapshot of their potential tenant's financial situation. However, unlike the credit bureaus, Naborly uses an algorithm and a team of trained human analysts to builds a different type of credit report. 

The algorithm analyzes roughly 500 data points on each potential tenant across identity, income, employment, credit, criminal, as well as rental history records sourced from private data vendors or open source databases. And also, Naborly even conducts social media analysis, such as applicants’ Facebook profiles (*for example, this helps to identify if the applicants might have a pet dog that they didn't disclose with their application*). Furthermore, Naborly looks at macroeconomic trends such as the price of gas, the stability of the economy locally versus nationally, and how that applicant's field of work is faring.

Some Data Point Examples:
*Equifax report and score*
*Identity verification*
*Employment and income verification*
*Previous address verification*
*Employment stability analysis*
*Pet liability analysis*
*Property suitability analysis*
*Projected tenancy outcomes*
*Rent to income ratio*
*Debt to income ratio*
*Sex offenders registry check (U.S. only) *

Then Naborly feeds those data to a machine learning system “**SHERLY**” that calculates a risk score between 400 and 900 (the higher the better) within 90 minutes. The risk score helps landlords to identify any potential risks associated with the applicants. Naborly grants landlords in the U.S. and Canada fast and affordable access to comprehensive tenant credit reports and benefits property managers and real estate professionals by giving access to screening data and tools to perform tenant due diligence.

### Rent Guarantee:
Comparing to other startups who provides similar services, Naborly also offers rent guarantee. Aiming protects the landlord for the full term of the lease, Naborly acts as a guarantor on the lease, meaning if the tenant ever defaults then Naborly steps in and covers the rent for up to six months.

## Results:
### Naborly’s Market Position:
According to the Naborly’s estimation, it is generating revenue about an average $12000 per day, and about 150 new landlords daily. This clearly shows the great potential of Fintech and Landlord Services. The company is now having fifteen employees, and positioning around at a middle tire level comparing to other startups in the Real Estate Industry (*as shown in graph1*).

### Recommendations:
Naborly aims to facilitate tenant screening process and to minimize the risks for landlords by leveraging the power of technology and data. However, for improving the quality of property management services, Naborly might have overlooked the needs of tenants. Specifically, the needs of interaction with the property owner or mangers. For example, an applicant might need more information about the property, a tenant might need a prompt response from landlords in regarding to property maintenance, and some tenants might need the landlords to provide feedback and endorsements that can be used in their profile to apply to future rentals. It would be recommended to have an online dashboard or APP that allows interaction between tenants and landlords. And also, it could be beneficial to create a Robo-advising system that enables 24/7 property management services.
